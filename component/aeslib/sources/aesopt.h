 This file contains the compilation options for AES (Rijndael) and code
 that is common across encryption, key scheduling and table generation.

    OPERATION

    These source code files implement the AES algorithm Rijndael designed by
    Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. The version in aes.c is designed for
    block and key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits (16, 24 and 32 bytes) while
    that in aespp.c provides for block and keys sizes of 128, 160, 192, 224
    and 256 bits (16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 bytes).  This file is a common header
    file for these two implementations and for aesref.c, which is a reference
    implementation.

    This version is designed for flexibility and speed using operations on
    32-bit words rather than operations on bytes.  It provides aes_both fixed
    and  dynamic block and key lengths and can also run with either big or
    little endian internal byte order (see aes.h).  It inputs block and key
    lengths in bytes with the legal values being  16, 24 and 32 for aes.c and
    16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 for aespp.c

    THE CIPHER INTERFACE

    aes_08t         (an unsigned  8-bit type)
    aes_32t         (an unsigned 32-bit type)
    aes_fret        (a signed 16 bit type for function return values)
    aes_good        (value != 0, a good return)
    aes_bad         (value == 0, an error return)
    struct aes_ctx  (structure for the cipher encryption context)
    struct aes_ctx  (structure for the cipher decryption context)
    aes_rval        the function return type (aes_fret if not DLL)

    C subroutine calls:

      aes_rval aes_set_block_size(unsigned int blen, aes_ctx cx[1]);
      aes_rval aes_set_encrypt_key(const unsigned char in_key[],
                                            unsigned int klen, aes_ctx cx[1]);
      aes_rval aes_encrypt_block(const unsigned char in_blk[],
                                unsigned char out_blk[], const aes_ctx cx[1]);

      aes_rval aes_dec_len(unsigned int blen, aes_ctx cx[1]);
      aes_rval aes_set_decrypt_key(const unsigned char in_key[],
                                            unsigned int klen, aes_ctx cx[1]);
      aes_rval aes_decrypt_block(const unsigned char in_blk[],
                                unsigned char out_blk[], const aes_ctx cx[1]);

    IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are using this C interface and your compiler does
    not set the memory used for objects to zero before use, you will need to
    ensure that cx.n_blk is set to zero before using these subroutine calls.

    C++ aes class subroutines:

      class AESclass    for encryption
      class AESclass    for decryption

      aes_rval len(unsigned int blen = 16);
      aes_rval key(const unsigned char in_key[], unsigned int klen);
      aes_rval blk(const unsigned char in_blk[], unsigned char out_blk[]);

      aes_rval len(unsigned int blen = 16);
      aes_rval key(const unsigned char in_key[], unsigned int klen);
      aes_rval blk(const unsigned char in_blk[], unsigned char out_blk[]);

    The block length inputs to set_block and set_key are in numbers of
    BYTES, not bits.  The calls to subroutines must be made in the above
    order but multiple calls can be made without repeating earlier calls
    if their parameters have not changed. If the cipher block length is
    variable but set_blk has not been called before cipher operations a
    value of 16 is assumed (that is, the AES block size). In contrast to
    earlier versions the block and key length parameters are now checked
    for correctness and the encryption and decryption routines check to
    ensure that an appropriate key has been set before they are called.

    COMPILATION

    The files used to provide AES (Rijndael) are

    a. aes.h for the definitions needed for use in C.
    b. aescpp.h for the definitions needed for use in C++.
    c. aesopt.h for setting compilation options (also includes common
       code).
    d. aescrypt.c for encryption and decrytpion, or
    e. aescrypt.asm for encryption and decryption using assembler code.
    f. aeskey.c for key scheduling.
    g. aestab.c for table loading or generation.

    The assembler code uses the NASM assembler. The above files provice
    block and key lengths of 16, 24 and 32 bytes (128, 192 and 256 bits).
    If aescrypp.c and aeskeypp.c are used instead of aescrypt.c and
    aeskey.c respectively, the block and key lengths can then be 16, 20,
    24, 28 or 32 bytes. However this code has not been optimised to the
    same extent and is hence slower (esepcially for the AES block size
    of 16 bytes).

    To compile AES (Rijndael) for use in C code use aes.h and exclude
    the AES_DLL define in aes.h

    To compile AES (Rijndael) for use in in C++ code use aescpp.h and
    exclude the AES_DLL define in aes.h

    To compile AES (Rijndael) in C as a Dynamic Link Library DLL) use
    aes.h, include the AES_DLL define and compile the DLL.  If using
    the test files to test the DLL, exclude aes.c from the test build
    project and compile it with the same defines as used for the DLL
    (ensure that the DLL path is correct)

    CONFIGURATION OPTIONS (here and in aes.h)

    a. define BLOCK_SIZE in aes.h to set the cipher block size (16, 24
       or 32 for the standard code, or 16, 20, 24, 28 or 32 for the
       extended code) or leave this undefined for dynamically variable
       block size (this will result in much slower code).
    b. set AES_DLL in aes.h if AES (Rijndael) is to be compiled as a DLL
    c. You may need to set PLATFORM_BYTE_ORDER to define the byte order.
    d. If you want the code to run in a specific internal byte order, then
       INTERNAL_BYTE_ORDER must be set accordingly.
    e. set other configuration options decribed below.

/*  5. BYTE ORDER WITHIN 32 BIT WORDS

    The fundamental data processing units in Rijndael are 8-bit bytes. The
    input, output and key input are all enumerated arrays of bytes in which
    bytes are numbered starting at zero and increasing to one less than the
    number of bytes in the array in question. This enumeration is only used
    for naming bytes and does not imply any adjacency or order relationship
    from one byte to another. When these inputs and outputs are considered
    as bit sequences, bits 8*n to 8*n+7 of the bit sequence are mapped to
    byte[n] with bit 8n+i in the sequence mapped to bit 7-i within the byte.
    In this implementation bits are numbered from 0 to 7 starting at the
    numerically least significant end of each byte (bit n represents 2^n).

    However, Rijndael can be implemented more efficiently using 32-bit
    words by packing bytes into words so that bytes 4*n to 4*n+3 are placed
    into word[n]. While in principle these bytes can be assembled into words
    in any positions, this implementation only supports the two formats in
    which bytes in adjacent positions within words also have adjacent byte
    numbers. This order is called big-endian if the lowest numbered bytes
    in words have the highest numeric significance and little-endian if the
    opposite applies.

    This code can work in either order irrespective of the order used by the
    machine on which it runs. Normally the internal byte order will be set
    to the order of the processor on which the code is to be run but this
    define can be used to reverse this in special situations

/*  6. FAST INPUT/OUTPUT OPERATIONS.

    On some machines it is possible to improve speed by transferring the
    bytes in the input and output arrays to and from the internal 32-bit
    variables by addressing these arrays as if they are arrays of 32-bit
    words.  On some machines this will always be possible but there may
    be a large performance penalty if the byte arrays are not aligned on
    the normal word boundaries. On other machines this technique will
    lead to memory access errors when such 32-bit word accesses are not
    properly aligned. The option SAFE_IO avoids such problems but will
    often be slower on those machines that support misaligned access
    (especially so if care is taken to align the input  and output byte
    arrays on 32-bit word boundaries). If SAFE_IO is not defined it is
    assumed that access to byte arrays as if they are arrays of 32-bit

/*  If there are no global variables, the AES tables are placed in
    a structure and a pointer is added to the AES context. If this
    facility is used, the calling program has to ensure that this
    pointer is managed appropriately. In particular, the value of
    the t_dec(in,it) item in the table structure must be set to zero
    in order to ensure that the tables are initialised. In practice
    the three code sequences in aeskey.c that control the calls to
    gen_tabs() and the gen_tabs() routine itself will require some
    changes for a specific implementation. If global variables are
    available it will generally be preferable to use them with the
    precomputed FIXED_TABLES option that uses static global tables.

    The following defines can be used to control the way the tables
    are defined, initialised and used in embedded environments that
    require special features for these purposes

    the 't_dec' construction is used to declare fixed table arrays
    the 't_set' construction is used to set fixed table values
    the 't_use' construction is used to access fixed table values

    256 byte tables:

        t_xxx(s,box)    => forward S box
        t_xxx(i,box)    => inverse S box

    256 32-bit word OR 4 x 256 32-bit word tables:

        t_xxx(f,n)      => forward normal round
        t_xxx(f,l)      => forward last round
        t_xxx(i,n)      => inverse normal round
        t_xxx(i,l)      => inverse last round
        t_xxx(l,s)      => key schedule table
        t_xxx(i,m)      => key schedule table

    Other variables and tables:

        t_xxx(in,it)    => the table initialsation flag
        t_xxx(r,c)      => the rcon table
